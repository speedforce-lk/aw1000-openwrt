Official Firmware

The official firmware release of ROOter contains all the bug fixes and new features that were available on the release date.

There are a number of different ROOter images provided and what features they contain depends on the router and on your desire. First of all, routers that have only 8meg of flash are limited in the features that they will have. They will have the same modem support that all routers share but have a smaller list of router features included. 8meg routers do not have any USB storage (Samba) support but do have OpenVpn and Wireguard.

With routers that have 16meg or more of flash you can choose to use a firmware that has Load Balancing installed. This is useful if you have multiple Internet sources but is not neded if you use a single modem. Firmware with or without Load Balancing are included.
